# PES-IO
SGQ-Scenario Gap Quest
Scenario: Talks about the current state of stake holders and their expectations about companys profits
Gap: Is a representation of problems which can be faced 
Quest: Analyze the problems occuring in the market and to see the future prospects

#Steps to make the project
1.Find a problem statement
2.SGQ
3.Represent the problem
4.Create an EDA
5.Make the model
6.Do the Testing and LSTM
7.Performance matrices
8.Presentation

#EDA
Stands for Exploratory Data Analysis,it helps in data analytics process to understand the data in depth and learn the different data characteristics, often with visual means.
Tools which we use to analyse data: pandas,matplotlib

#LSTM
LSTM stands for long short-term memory networks designed to handle sequential data

#MAPE
Stands for Mean absolute percentage error measures how far off predictions are on average to the model.
Example: The value is 4% that means there is a difference of 4% with the actual and predicted value
If Mape is 0% then its called overfitting
The best value to consider for mape should be below 5% to be an accurate forecasting value if above it indicates low accuracy

#MAE
Stands for mean absolute error it's the average over the test sample of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation where all individual differences have equal weight
