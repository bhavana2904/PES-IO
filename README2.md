# PES-IO
Box plot: Graphical summary of a data set.
This graph represents the minimum, maximum, median, first quartile and third quartile in the data set.
#Steps to plot:
1.First find the mean of given set of data.
2.Calculate percentile Q1=25%,Q2=50%,Q3=75%(Q stands for quatar of each plot)
3.Calculate the width of each quater by Q1-min value,Q2-median value,Q3-max value
4.Calculate IGR=Q3-Q1
5.L.V=Q1-1.5(IGR) and U.V=Q3-1.5(IGR)

#ANOVA
Stands for Analysis of Variance a statistical method to analyze differences among group means in a sample.

#Seasonality
Changes which occur over a period of time or changes which can be preidcted are represented in a dataset
Example: During holidays the sales go up

They get to know what all outcomes they can expect(Examples: how customers are getting benefitted?,Which month has highest number of sales? etc.).
After that they get to know what all actions to be taken like to find a proper solutions to help the customers and increase the profits.

#Hypothesis Testing
Statistically decide weather the survey for the data is correct or not and to check weather the chances of the predicted data can be true
